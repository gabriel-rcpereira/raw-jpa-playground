#Main goal

Raw Java application to apply the JPA, Entity Manager and Hibernate concepts.
I've learned how to implement entities and their relationships but the core principles were left to delivery value
as fast as possibly.
In order to continue my  strategy to learn new topics: "Learn the basics, solve the problem and after that learn deeply to solve the outbox cases"
